  -d '{
    "username": "ops_user",
    "email": "ops@yourcompany.com", 
    "password": "SecurePass123",

  }'

# Login and get token
curl -X POST https://YOUR_DEPLOYED_URL/api/auth/login \

## 🆘 Need Help?

If deployment fails:
1. Check logs on your platform
2. Ensure Python 3.8+ is used
3. Try `requirements-legacy.txt` if compatibility issues
4. Run `python simple_test.py` locally first

**Your Flask API is production-ready and secure! 🎉**
